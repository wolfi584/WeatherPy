# WeatherPy

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to implement a few changes to the PlanMyTripp app that Jack really loves. Additions include adding weather descriptions, a filter for weather preferences used to find possible travel locations and nearby hotels, listing four cities to make an itinerary, apply a Google API to make a route betwween these four cities, and create a marker layer map.  

This challenge is organized into three sections: retrieving weather data, creating a customer travel destination map, and creating a travel itinerary map.
